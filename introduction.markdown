# Introduction

If you're just starting to learn about Ruby, it can seem a bit overwhelming to learn how many tools are associated with the language: Gems, rbenv/rvm, Bundler, rubocop, Rake, databases, Rails, and more. New developers are faced with an even bigger challenge: they need to learn about the command line and environment, git, programmer's editors, as well as all the concepts of programming. This eco-system of ruby and its development tools is the glue that makes ruby a useful and practical software development language.

Fortunately, you don't need to learn all of these tools at once, and even those you do need to know can be useful after just a short introduction to the most commonly used features. Here at Launch School, for example, we teach about many of these tools as they come up in the curriculum. Yes, the introductions come hot and heavy initially, especially for new developers, but nothing is presented before you need it.

Since we already cover much of this material elsewhere, this guide isn't about teaching you how to use these tools. Instead, we're going to concentrate on a handful of tools -- namely ruby itself, rbenv/rvm, Gems, and Bundler -- and talk about how they fit into the world of ruby and your computer system. The information we present here is aimed at helping you learn what these tools do, how they do it, how they interact with your computer, and how you can diagnose and even fix problems that arise from their use.

As with other Launch School materials, we will assume that you are using a UNIX-like environment, such as that offered by Macs, Linux, and online programming environments like [Cloud9](https://c9.io/). While it is possible to use Ruby under Windows, doing so can be extremely complex; if you must use Windows, we recommend using an environment like Cloud9.
